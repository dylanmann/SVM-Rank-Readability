To assess safety, tolerance and efficacy of liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) in a large unselected series of paediatric cancer/haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients requiring LAMB therapy.  The study included 84 children and adolescents (median age: 11 years) who received 141 consecutive courses of LAMB for prophylaxis (32), empirical therapy (83), possible (19) or probable/proven (7) invasive infections. LAMB was administered until intolerance or maximum efficacy at dosages individually determined by the responsible physician.  Fifty-nine courses were post-HSCT (42%, 49 allogeneic), and 92 courses were started during granulocytopenia (65%). The median duration of LAMB therapy was 13 days (range 1-79), and the median maximum dosage was 2.8 mg/kg (range 0.93-5.10). Mild-to-moderate adverse events were noted during 109 courses (77%; hepatic, 58.8%; electrolyte wasting, 52.5%; renal, 31.9%; infusion-related reactions, 8.5%); adverse events necessitating discontinuation of LAMB occurred in 6 courses (4.3%; renal, 3; anaphylaxis, 2; hepatic, 1). While median hepatic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and blood urea nitrogen values were slightly (P &lt; 0.01) higher at end of treatment (EOT), bilirubin and creatinine values were not different from baseline. Complete or partial responses were observed in 16/19 and 2/7 courses for possible and probable/proven invasive infections. Thirty-two of 33 courses of prophylaxis and 74 of 83 courses of empirical therapy were completed with success. Overall survival was 90.8% at 3 months post-EOT.  LAMB had acceptable safety and tolerance and was useful in prevention and treatment in unselected, mostly granulocytopenic paediatric patients undergoing treatment for cancer or HSCT.
