Free radical induced polymerization of vinyl monomers such as the acryloyl peptides described here is a facile and rapid reaction used routinely, for example, in the polymerization of acrylamide and bisacrylamide for the assembly of polyacrylamide gels. The technology allows the incorporation of many of the same or different peptide determinants into a single polymer chain. In this study large polymers containing multiple copies of peptides representing T- and B-cell determinants of influenza haemagglutinin were constructed. The determinants retained antigenicity after the polymerization procedure and the polymers were highly immunogenic; the levels of antibody obtained after a single dose of polymeric immunogen were at least as great as those achieved only after repeated doses of the equivalent monomeric peptide. The technology has a wide range of potential applications, not the least significant of which is the construction of designer immunogens for third generation vaccine candidates.
