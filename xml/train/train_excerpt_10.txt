Epilepsy is the most frequent presenting sign in patients with cavernous angiomas and is the major cause of morbility. Persistence of seizures after surgical treatment prompted many authors to examine the possibility of removing the cavernoma and the surrounding tissue. In our series of 53 cavernous angiomas, all the 35 patients with preoperative seizures underwent surgery by means of lesionectomy alone. One hundred percent of patients with less than five preoperative seizures and/or an history under 12 months was seizure free, while only 62.5% of patients with more than five seizures and/or an history longer than 12 months was seizure free. Number and duration of seizures before surgery seems to be the most important factor in the seizure outcome after surgical treatment.
