Based on quantitative pharmaco-EEG"" using computer-analyzed EEG (CEEG) measurements"," unknown CNS effects of lisuride hydrogen maleate (LHM) were established. CEEG profiles of LHM in low dosages (less than or equal to 10 mcg) are similar to CNS ""inhibitory"" compounds"," while in higher dosages (25 mcg to 100 mcg) they resemble ""psychostimulant"" compounds. By measuring the brain function using computer period analysis of cerebral biopotentials", dose-efficacy relations were found (in the range of 25-75 mcg) which suggest the bioavailability of LHM at the CNS level. By comparing the CEEG profiles of LHM with the previously studied compounds," five different clinical uses of LHM were predicted. The pilot trials suggest that LHM may have therapeutic potentials in patients with ""aging"" and/or organic brain syndromes", and in children with behavioral disturbances.
