Vapour barrier membranes are often used as soil gas retarder in building construction. While vapour permeance characteristics of these membranes are well known and specified in Canadian standards, their radon diffusion coefficients are yet not available. This study provides test results of radon diffusion coefficients for 10 vapour barrier membranes commonly used in Canadian building construction.
