Many confounding variables (age, sex, race, income level) may contribute to an incorrect estimate of the prevalence of hypertension in the obese population. Furthermore, as far as methodology is concerned, both casual morning BP measurement and, the use, in the obese patient, of inappropriate cuffs both also contribute significantly to the overestimation with the inclusion of false positives even in relevant percentages. Different types of obesity (android or gynoid; visceral or subcutaneous) should be considered when enrolling obese patients in prevalence studies being android or visceral obesity at a higher hypertensive risk. At last and overall, universally recognized cutoff-points for obesity and hypertension should always be used when studying prevalence of hypertension among general population and/or among obese patients. When such conditions are not taken into account, inaccurate and misleading conclusions on the real prevalence of hypertension in obesity may result.
