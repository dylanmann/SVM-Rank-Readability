The nucleoli and chromatin clumps of ovarian cells contain important features in discriminating malignant cells from normal ones. In geometric properties, the ovarian nucleoli and chromatin clumps appear as irregularly shaped dark spots in the nuclear images from specimens immunohistochemically stained with antibody to Mib-1. Malignant cells often have more active and larger nucleoli and chromatin clumps. However, estimating the size of the nucleoli or chromatin clumps is a difficult task since it is not easy to recognize and accurately separate the regions of nucleoli and chromatin clumps from the rest of the nuclei that are highly irregular and variant in contents and intensities. In this paper, we develop a method to derive a parameter called power ratio that is proportionally related to the size of nucleoli and chromatin clumps based on an ideal nuclear model without the region segmentation of nucleoli or chromatin clumps. Results of characterization of the parameter and comparison between malignant and normal cells are provided.
