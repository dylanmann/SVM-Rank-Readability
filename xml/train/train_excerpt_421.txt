This paper reviews a number of studies relating to religion and coping with chronic illness, emphasizing those aspects relevant to palliative care. After pointing out that religious and existential needs are common in chronic illness, a critical examination is made of those studies which purport to demonstrate associations between spiritual beliefs, religious practices and psychological prognosis. Recommendations are made as to how religious issues can be dealt with in clinical practice, with particular relevance to the multidisciplinary palliative care team.
