Radiolabelling of leukocytes using labelled phagocytosed technetium-99m (99mTc) colloidal radiopharmaceuticals has been reported as a method for imaging infection. This in vivo study compares the use of leukocytes labelled using 99mTc stannous fluoride colloid with leukocytes labelled using indium-111 (111In) oxinate. A total of 26 patients (10 male, 16 female; mean age 52 years, range 23-88 years) referred for the investigation of possible infection were studied using both leukocyte labelling methods simultaneously. Images were acquired 4h and 24h after re-injection of the labelled cells. The images were evaluated qualitatively by two nuclear medicine physicians. The results show a high degree of concordance between the techniques: 11 of the 28 images showed a focus of leukocyte accumulation with both techniques at 24h, and 13 out of 28 showed a normal appearance at 24h with both methods. In four cases the results were discordant; the 99mTc stannous fluoride colloid labelled leukocytes gave a false positive appearance at 24h in three patients and a false negative in one. In conclusion, colloid labelling of leukocytes offers a sensitive method for the detection of infective foci coupled with the high resolution imaging offered by 99mTc. It has the advantage over other in vitro labelling methods of being a simpler, non-labour-intensive procedure employing whole blood, and its use should be considered by departments that have limited facilities for in vitro leukocyte labelling.
