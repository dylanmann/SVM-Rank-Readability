We have cloned and sequenced the single-copy nuclear gene (GapC) encoding the complete 335-amino acid cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC) from the red alga Gracilaria verrucosa. The proline residue which contributes to the specificity of NAD+ binding in other GAPC-like proteins is present. Putative regulatory regions, including GC-rich regions, a GATA element, and 11-base T- and T/G-clusters, but excluding TATA- and CCAAT-boxes, were identified upstream. Two types of GapC cDNAs differing in polyadenylation site were characterized. An 80-bp phase-two spliceosomal intron was identified in a novel position interrupting the highly conserved cofactor-coding region I. The G. verrucosa GAPC was easily aligned with other known GAPC-type sequences. Inferred phylogenetic trees place red algae among the eukaryote crown taxa, although with modest bootstrap support and without stable resolution among related GAPC lineages.
