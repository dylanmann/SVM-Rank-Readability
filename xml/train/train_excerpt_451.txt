Lipids form a diverse group of water-insoluble molecules that include triacylglycerides, phosphoglycerides, sterols and sphingolipids. They play several important roles at cellular and organismal levels. Fatty acids are the major building blocks for the synthesis of triacylglycerides, which are mainly used for energy storage. Phosphoglycerides, together with sterols and sphingolipids, represent the major structural components of biological membranes. Lipids can also have important roles in signalling, functioning as second messengers and as hormones. There is increasing evidence that cancer cells show specific alterations in different aspects of lipid metabolism. These alterations can affect the availability of structural lipids for the synthesis of membranes, the synthesis and degradation of lipids that contribute to energy homeostasis and the abundance of lipids with signalling functions. Changes in lipid metabolism can affect numerous cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and motility. This review will examine some of the alterations in lipid metabolism that have been reported in cancer, at both cellular and organismal levels, and discuss how they contribute to different aspects of tumourigenesis.
