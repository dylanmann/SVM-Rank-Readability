Bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) localize in premetastatic niche through chemokines and integrins signals and establish clusters that precede the arrival of even single metastatic tumor cell at distant site. CSCs demonstrate an increased metastatic propensity and would seem likely candidates for the acquisition of migratory capabilities and propagation of heterogeneous tumor cell populations to different target organs. Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), FOXM1 and Notch pathways and signaling molecules such as integrin and chemokine could dictate their fate.  In this review, the molecular mechanisms of premetastatic niche onset are summarized.  Premetastatic niche is defined as a fertile microenvironment that forms in metastatic target organ and facilitates the invasion, survival and/or proliferation of metastatic tumor cells, providing a novel mechanism for the promotion of metastasis. Drugs targeting premetastatic niche could represent a new promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of bone metastases.
