The neonatal intestinal immune system is still undergoing development at birth, leading to a higher susceptibility to mucosal infections. In this study, we investigated the effect of poly(I:C) on controlling enteric infection by the protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum in neonatal mice. After poly(I:C) administration, a rapid reduction in parasite burden was observed and proved to be dependent on CD11c(+) cells and TLR3/TRIF signaling. Protection against C. parvum required additional signals provided by the gut flora through TLR5 and MyD88 signaling. This cooperation gave rise to higher levels of expression of critical mutually dependent cytokines such as interleukin 12p40 and type 1 and type 2 interferons, the last 2 being known to play a key role in the elimination of infected enterocytes. Our findings demonstrate in neonatal mice how gut flora synergizes with poly(I:C) to elicit protective intestinal immunity against an intracellular pathogen.
