We report here the isolation of three members of a new family of antimicrobial peptides from the hemolymph of shrimps Penaeus vannamei in which immune response has not been experimentally induced. The three molecules display antimicrobial activity against fungi and bacteria with a predominant activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The complete sequences of these peptides were determined by a combination of enzymatic cleavages, Edman degradation, mass spectrometry, and cDNA cloning using a hemocyte cDNA library. The mature molecules (50 and 62 residues) are characterized by an NH2-terminal domain rich in proline residues and a COOH-terminal domain containing three intramolecular disulfide bridges. One of these molecules is post-translationally modified by a pyroglutamic acid at the first position. Comparison of the data obtained from the cDNA clones and mass spectrometry showed that two of these peptides are probably COOH-terminally amidated by elimination of a glycine residue. These molecules with no evident homology to other hitherto described antimicrobial peptides were named penaeidins.
