In inflammation, cells interact with extracellular matrices or neighboring cells by a spatio-temporal intervention pattern of specific cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules. Resident cells of the injured tissue communicate with circulating effector cells by cytokines and direct cell-cell contact. These cytokines stimulate expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E- and P-selectin on endothelial cell surfaces and upregulate beta 2-integrins and ICAM-1 on luminal leukocytes. White blood cells then adhere to the activated endothelial cells, migrate through the vessel wall, and penetrate areas of infection or tissue damage. The basis for a cellular immune response is formed by the interaction between T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells amplified by adhesion molecule LFA-1,2,3 to ICAM-1 binding.
