Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in several types of cancers, but its role in gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is yet to be determined. In the present study, TFPI-2 expression in GBC tissues was examined, and its inhibitory activities against GBC growth were evaluated in vitro and in vivo after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of TFPI-2 (Ad5-TFPI-2) was constructed to restore the expression of TFPI-2 in GBC cell lines (GBC-SD, SGC-996, NOZ) and xenograft tumors. Immunohistochemical staining showed that TFPI-2 was significantly downregulated in GBC tissue specimens. Ad5-TFPI-2 could significantly inhibit GBC growth both in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis analysis and western blotting assay demonstrated that Ad5-TFPI-2 could induce the apoptosis of both GBC cell lines and tissues by promoting the activities of cytochrome c, Bax, caspase-3 and -9 and suppressing Bcl-2 activity. These data indicated that TFPI-2 acts as a tumor suppressor in GBC, and may have a potential role in gene therapy for GBC.
